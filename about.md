I am fascinated by all the Deep Learning research and it's applications in computer vision, robotics and genomics. I am currently studying about several deep learning architectures and trying to find an explainable mathematical framework to find new architectures and chose among them. In the meantime, I will be writing blogs about whatever important concepts I came across related to Deep Learning.

 All my open source code is available on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/sunil10000).
