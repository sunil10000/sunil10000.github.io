I am deeply fascinated by all the Deep Learning research and it's applications in computer vision, robotics and genomics. I am currently studying (or trying to find) an explainable mathematical framework to find new deep learning architectures and chose among them. 

In the meantime, I will be writing blogs about whatever important concepts I came across related to Deep Learning. All my open source code is available on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/sunil10000).
